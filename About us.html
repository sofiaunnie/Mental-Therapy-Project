            <p> ONS Mental health was formed in 2022 with the commitment to promote mental 
                health as a critical part of overall wellness, including prevention services for all;
                Early identification and intervention for those at risk; integrated care, services, 
                and supports for those who need them; with recovery as the main goal in Nigeria and 
                across the world.</p>
            <p>We encourage open and honest dialogue about issues that cause you distress. 
                Through your relationship with our therapist, we'll work to identify and understand 
                how these stressors are impacting your life, plus develop strategies to manage the symptoms.
            </p>
            <p>We ensure our clients of our commitment to integrity, dedication, hard work, and strive to impose and 
                communicate at all times our values and philosophy that will continue to priotize your Mental Health.
